## About

Application developed over training by Senior Software Engineering [Emerson Broga](https://emersonbroga.com/) using NodeJS as main technology and much more.
The goal is to be able to create an account where you can store as many Social and Professional Links as you want; Create, List, Edit and Delete links. We can say that
the main focus is to learn and practice the framework, language, libs, etc. <br /> You can find the FrontEnd of this application [here](https://github.com/jvictor-am/Link-Storage-FrontEnd).
